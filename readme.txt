About:

This code is the accelerated version of the GBH [1] implemented from LIBSVX v3.0 (http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~jcorso/r/supervoxels/) [2].
Based on my testing, this code consuming only 1/10 computational time and memory of the implementation from LIBSVX on normal paremeter settings.

We accelerate the code in order to extend our hierarchical image segmentation work [3] in the future.
If you use this code and publish your results, please cite [1], [2] and [3].
------------------------------------------------
Notice:

1. The I/O part of the code only supports Windows platform for now. 
   It should be fairly easy to modify the I/O function back to linux platform as that in LIBSVX.   
2. The segmentation results might be a little bit different from that generated by LIBSVX v3.0 because the contour strength between segments might be the same and we might have different merging orders for those segments.

------------------------------------------------
Usage:

Please refer to chapter 2.2.1 in the LIBSVX tutorial file (tutorial.pdf).
